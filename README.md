# PKGBUILDs

This repo represents my various AUR packages' PKGBUILDs.

The master branch contains a Makefile and PKGBUILD suitable for any sources
hosted on GitHub with a valid `make install`. Feel free to adopt this to your
own projects. I will never rewrite history on master.

There will be one branch per project where I update these files to be
project-specific as required. These are the branches I release from. These
branches are considered fair game for rebases, so I wouldn't branch from them.
